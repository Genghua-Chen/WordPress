Hadoop MapReduce in python
1. Choose the TXT version of any book you want from Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
2. Use Python to write a Hadoop MapReduce program (that you run locally, not in Hadoop) to calculate the word count.
3. Simulate the MapReduce steps similar to what was shown in class (either on EC2 server or your local machine): https://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

4. You can even use the Python code above as reference -- but do NOT copy-paste, just use it as a reference to write your own Python map-reduce based on it.
5. Take the word count output of the step #2 above, and insert this data into one SQL or NoSQL database of your choice. You can use either MySQL (SQL) or MongoDB (NoSQL). If you want to use any other database, please message me ahead of time to get approval.
